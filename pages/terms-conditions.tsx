                            We respect your right to privacy and won&apos;t give

                        <h4>1.3. Platform for Communication</h4>
                        <p>
                            You accept, understand, and agree that the Site is
                            an online store where you can buy the services and
                            goods mentioned at the specified price whenever you
                            want, from wherever you are, using the payment
                            method of your choosing. You also agree and
                            understand that we are merely acting as an
                            intermediary and are unable to participate in or
                            exert any kind of control over any transactions made
                            through the Site or a payment gateway made
                            accessible to you by a third-party service provider.
                            In light of this, the payment agreement on the Site
                            shall only be a two-party agreement between you and
                            the service provider as specified on our Site.

                        <p>
                            We shall do every effort to make sure that the Site
                            is constantly accessible, uninterrupted, and
                            error-free. This cannot be assured, though, because
                            of how the Internet and the Site operate. Your
                            access to the Site may also periodically be paused
                            or limited to allow for servicing, cleaning, or the
                            unannounced introduction of new facilities or
                            services. The frequency and length of any such
                            suspension or limitation will be kept to a minimum.
                        </p>

                        <h4>1.5. Licence To Access The Site</h4>
                        <p>
                            By using the Site, you must be at least 18 years old
                            or be under the supervision of a parent or legal
                            guardian in order to confirm that you are able to
                            enter into legally binding agreements. In accordance
                            with the terms and conditions outlined below, we now
                            give you a non-transferable, revocable, and
                            non-exclusive licence to use the Site for the sole
                            purpose of making reservations for services made
                            available on the Site. Except as expressly
                            authorised in advance by us, commercial use or usage
                            on behalf of any third party is prohibited. If you
                            are registering on behalf of a business entity, you
                            guarantee that you are able to bind that entity to
                            this User Agreement and that both you and the
                            business entity will abide by all regulations
                            governing online trade. No individual or business
                            organisation may register on the Site more than
                            once. The licence granted in this clause may be
                            terminated immediately and without prior notice for
                            any violation of these Terms and Conditions.

                        <h4>1.6. Your Conduct</h4>

                        <p>
                            You are not permitted to use the website in any way
                            that interrupts, damages, or impairs in any way the
                            Site or access to it. You must refrain from taking
                            any actions that could endanger or threaten to
                            endanger the Website, its officers, representatives,
                            stakeholders, or any other parties who are either
                            directly or indirectly connected to the Website or
                            whose access to it may be disrupted, damaged, or
                            compromised in any way. You are aware that the Site
                            may only be used for legitimate reasons and that you
                            alone, and not us, are entirely responsible for all
                            electronic communications and information sent from
                            your computer to us.
                        </p>

                        <h4>1.7. Your Submission</h4>
                        <p>
                            Your questions, reviews, comments, and suggestions
                            (collectively, &quot;Submissions&quot;) that you
                            send to us or submit through the Site will become
                            our full and exclusive property and won&apos;t be
                            returned to you. You grant us the right to use your
                            name in connection with any reviews, comments, or
                            other content you post on the Site in addition to
                            the rights applicable to any Submission when you
                            post comments or reviews there. You may not give us
                            or other parties misleading information about the
                            origin of any Submissions by using a false e-mail
                            address, posing as someone other than yourself, or
                            in any other way. We may modify or remove any
                            submissions without warning or taking any other
                            action that may be appropriate given the
                            circumstances, but we are not bound to do so.
                        </p>

                        <h4>1.8. Claims Against Objectionable Content</h4>
                        <p>
                            It is not possible for us to be aware of the
                            contents of every product listed for sale, or every
                            remark or review that is displayed, despite the fact
                            that we list thousands of services and products for
                            sale offered by several sellers on the Site and host
                            numerous comments on listings. As a result, our
                            business model is &quot;claim, review, and
                            takedown.&quot; If you find any material that you
                            consider to be unlawful, objectionable (including,
                            but not limited to, sexually explicit material or
                            material that encourages racism, bigotry, hatred, or
                            physical harm), deceptive, misleading, abusive,
                            indecent, harassing, blasphemous, defamatory,
                            libellous, obscene, pornographic, pedophilic, or
                            menacing; ethnically objectionable; disparaging; or
                            otherwise harmful to third parties; or that relates
                            (&quot; objectionable content &quot;).Please contact
                            us right away by sending an email to
                            legal@CIPHER.com. We shall do every reasonable
                            effort to look into and remove any legitimately
                            objectionable content that has been reported within
                            a fair amount of time
                        </p>

                        <h4>1.9. Claims Against Infringing Content</h4>
                        <p>
                            We value other people&apos;s intellectual property.
                            Please contact us at legal@CIPHER.com if you suspect
                            that your intellectual property rights have been
                            violated in any way. We will use all reasonable
                            efforts to resolve your issue within a reasonable
                            amount of time. Please be sure to include your name,
                            address, and contact information as well as all
                            pertinent information about the alleged violation,
                            such as the name of the offending party, examples of
                            the violation, and supporting documentation. Please
                            be aware that giving insufficient information will
                            make your claim void and useless as a legal
                            argument. Furthermore, giving incorrect or
                            misleading information could constitute a crime that
                            results in legal action.
